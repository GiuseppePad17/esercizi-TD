    <h1>Birth Date to Astrological Sign</h1>
    <div style="width: 60%;">
        The horoscopes commonly reported in newspapers use the position of the sun at the time of one’s birth to try and predict the future.
        This system of astrology divides the year into twelve zodiac signs, as outline in the table below:


        Zodiac Sign	Date Range
        Capricorn	December 22 to January 19
        Aquarius	January 20 to February 18
        Pisces	February 19 to March 20
        Aries	March 21 to April 19
        Taurus	April 20 to May 20
        Gemini	May 21 to June 20
        Cancer	June 21 to July 22
        Leo	July 23 to August 22
        Virgo	August 23 to September 22
        Libra	September 23 to October 22
        Scorpio	October 23 to November 21
        Sagittarius	November 22 to December 21

        Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her month and day of birth.
        Then your program should return the user’s zodiac sign as part of an appropriate output message.

        Example:
        Month input: December
        Day input: 22
        Output: Capricorn
