        A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward.
        For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words.

        Write a program that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determine whether it is a palindrome. Display the result, including a meaningful output message.

        "Aibohphobia" is the extreme or irrational fear of palindromes.
        This word was constructed by prepending the -phobia suffix with its reverse, resulting in a palindrome.

        "Ailihphilia" is the fondness for or love of palindromes.
        It was constructed in the same manner from the -philia suffix.

        Example:
        Input: cat
        Output: cat is not a palindrome

        Input: wow
        Output: wow is a palindrome
