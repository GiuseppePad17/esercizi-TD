    <h1>What Color Is That Square?</h1>
    <div style="width: 60%;">
        Positions on a chess board are identified by a letter and a number.
        The letter identifies the column, while the number identifies the row, as shown below:
    </div>

        Write a program that reads a position from the user.
        Use an if statement to determine if the column begins with a black square or a white square.
        Then use modular arithmetic to report the color of the square in that row. Your program may assume that a valid position will always be entered. It does not need to perform any error checking.

        Example:
        Input = a1
        Output = black

        Input = d5
        Output = white
    </div>
